Hardware Simulation
===================

This directory contains a very simple, ZeroMQ based C application that demonstrates
communication between the C world (For example, a hardware driver) and Scala/Akka.

Compile with Makefile.Darwin for Mac or Makefile.Linux for Linux.
Note that an older version of ZeroMQ is needed (Version 2.2) that you may have to compile from the source.
